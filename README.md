# Motion-Detection-using-OpenCV
In video processing, a video can be represented with some hierarchical structure units, such as scene, shot and frame. Also, video frame is the lowest level in the hierarchical structure. The content-based video browsing and retrieval, video-content analysis use these structure units. In video retrieval, generally, video applications must first partition a given video sequence into video shots. A video shot is defined as an image or video frame sequence that presents continuous action. The frames in a video shot are captured from a single operation of one camera. The complete video sequence is generally formed by joining two or more video shots .We have used Twilio api for messaging. It is a api which provides sid, auth-token, messaging number for sending message. Libraries used:- Client, Credentials. When any motion it detected then message will be sent on users phoneWe have used Twilio api for messaging. Software requirements are:OpenCv 3:- used for reading webcam, Annaconda:- contain all the basic libraries used for detection and tracking, Os:- for importing files from disk, Numpy :- used for all the mathematical implementation. Playsound:- to read the sound file from the memory and play it during detection.
